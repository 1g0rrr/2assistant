# Custom device VS existing Android phone:

### 1) Same a level of convenience
- Physical (volume up) trigger button. Useful for walkie-talkie access to AI assistant.
- Single app mode. Makes your phone dedicated only for the assistant so it's always ready.
- Smaller size. Android smartphones can be really small, so you can wear them like a pendant.

### 2) No pre-orders
-  You can choose any smartphone available on the market that suits your needs. For example, the cheap Soyes xs16 or the waterproof Unichertz Atom.

### 3) Open Source
- Own control of your data and use an AI service you trust. 

# Uscases
- Wear your smartphone on your chest. The app takes pictures every 5 seconds. At the end of the day, you can ask the assistant questions, like what was the name of the guy you met, or the phone number that was written on the front of the building.
- Walkie-Tolkie Voices Recorder - ramble your thoughts while driving, or on the go and get your text polished with AI.
